Unlike a microchip, it's not for permanent ID, it is designed to make pet parenting simpler and it links to a unique profile where you can store your pet's info like medical history, contact info, and care instructions. Plus, it passively records a location when scanned!  It's a convenient way to manage everything in one place, especially when you aren't quite ready for a microchip.

(no cutesy shots)\n\nAnomaly shots, Ie scarred bitten ear in close up for a cat.. Polydactyl etc.. \n\nAlert status, your animal has been found and chip details scanned, heads up message..? (gone missing from backyard) \n\nRegular walk zone set parameters so that any distance trackers don't ping unless you over-ride it to missing status, simple slider setting like an avalanche transceiver is set to either transmit or search.. \n\n (some pets if familiar with a walk location who get loose may gravitate towards the walk zone which is why an override is necessary for minimising false flags when on a regular familiar zone for daily exercise. \n\nRoom for any salient detail.\nA \"trusted alternate persons\" slot for picking up a wandering pet  if original contact is unable to come out and collect (ie grandma /grandpa) that can only be released (seen along with a verification code) to ensure pet is handed over to authorised individuals (like a food delivery code)\n\nWould this be on a rolling subscription charge,  a buy in, and a fee for accessing details beyond a certain point, or something else?\n\nI could see it being useful to log adoption dogs from the outset, breeders (puppy shots would need to be updated) and useful to responsible breeders who may swoop in to take back a dog that has been dumped.. (so breeder details also give insight to a dog's dna / purebreed / mixed breed status which would help a shelter exponentially as to numerous factors,  breed rescue coordination etc (improving re-homing chances)\n\nInteresting in principle, how many similar products on the market and which country is this being developed for initially? \n\nCheers",

I\u2019m genuinely curious, cause that doesn\u2019t make any sense. Also AirTags last for a long while and don\u2019t require charging either, so they remove the need for someone to scan your pet\u2019s collar or even interact with a pet at all, not every cat or dog is gonna be cool with strangers. That\u2019s far from what I would consider simplicity. You could literally just make a collar that has a pouch for air tags and whatever the android equivalent are or one that doesn\u2019t require being scanned. If someone\u2019s cat gets outside and gets hurt or stuck somewhere, how is their owner supposed to know where to go look for them unless some random person walks past and notices the cat, especially if the cat isn\u2019t easily visible from wherever someone may HOPEFULLY walk past? Then how would that random person know what app to use and how? What if they don\u2019t have strong service or don\u2019t have data or enough battery to download an app that they will probably never use again?\n\nI know I\u2019m most likely being rude, but come on\u2026 whose idea was it to take something that already exists and make it more complicated? Just sell little pouches to attach to a collar that can hold a gps tracker like air tags. There\u2019s also plenty of similar products that are easier to use and track. I think there is a lot to improve on before this is a product worth using and even more to make it worth spending money on it.\n\nJust consider making changes, cause otherwise it\u2019s basically just a scam to make money while not offering anything that\u2019s actually helpful or simple to use. How are random people supposed to know they need to scan it? Are there going to be instructions in some waterproof pouch connected to the collar? What if an animal is skittish or aggressive towards strangers? It makes no sense. It seems like a waste of money.\n\nIf changes end up being made so the product is worth while and actually prioritizes simplicity then I would love to be updated to reconsider looking into using your product for my pets, especially my cat who goes pretty far sometimes when she goes outside.",
        "response": "Thanks for the thorough and honest feedback! We appreciate you taking the time to share your perspective on how we can improve.\n\nWhile our NFC Pet Tag isn't a real-time GPS tracker like an AirTag, it focuses on simplicity and accessibility, offering battery-free operation and instant access to vital pet information via any smartphone.

        "body": "That will help for me, sure. But I'm not the one who will be reading the collar. The point was that if he were to get out and go musing, a stranger who finds him can find me. \n\nBut for that to work, the person who finds the cat would need to know 1. That the collar contains digital information and 2. How to scan it immediately. \n\nFor a product like this, I would want it to be obvious to anyone who looks at the collar that they can scan it. I would want it to be really easy and obvious. Downloading an app is fine for me. But for other people, they aren't going to do that. Why would they? Assuming they even know it can be scanned, I don't think most people can be counted on to download an app to scan. \n\nThat's why I mentioned a QR code. Everyone instinctively knows what to do when they see a QR code. If there is a tiny note that says \"Scan the code to Help me get home.  Any random person who finds him would immediately know what to do. \n\nThen, you should make the app set up so that, when the code is scanned and someone visits the page, we get notified and get some kind of contact details. Even if you have it set up so that we can send a text through the app without having to divulge anyone personal information. \n\nIf you want this item to be desirable, it has to be to do more than an air tag and be easy to use. For me to invest in this, it would require:\n\nLive gps data\n\nCommunicate important information to the finder efficiently \n\nBe easy for anyone to know how to use at a glance. Needing an app to scan it makes it almost useless. People aren't going to download some random app off a pets collar. \n\nMake information easy to access for anyone who finds him. It should be obvious how to read the collar and people should know exactly how to do it. It shouldn't confuse anyone. \n\nA way to know when the info is viewed.\n\nGive me a way to contact the person who has my pet. The app can have a secure text feature so I can send a message through it without needing to divulge any personal info, including phone number. You should be able to facilitate the return of the pet",

I\u2019ve lived in the country since I was twelve, and have owned about sixty cats, so far. \n\n\nSo, what is it you want to tell me about?",

Just to clarify, the tag uses NFC (Near Field Communication) \u2013 when scanned, it shows the pet's profile and last known location, but it's not a GPS tracker.
