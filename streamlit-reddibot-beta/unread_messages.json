        "body": "Is it like the chip they\u2019d put in the dog at the vet?",
        "response": "That's a great question! Our NFC Pet Tag is similar to a vet's microchip in that it uses an embedded chip, but it's an external tag and doesn't require any surgery. Unlike a microchip, it's not for permanent ID, it is designed to make pet parenting simpler and it links to a unique profile where you can store your pet's info like medical history, contact info, and care instructions. Plus, it passively records a location when scanned!  It's a convenient way to manage everything in one place, especially when you aren't quite ready for a microchip.
