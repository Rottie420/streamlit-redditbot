Unlike a microchip, it's not for permanent ID, it is designed to make pet parenting simpler and it links to a unique profile where you can store your pet's info like medical history, contact info, and care instructions. Plus, it passively records a location when scanned!  It's a convenient way to manage everything in one place, especially when you aren't quite ready for a microchip.

(no cutesy shots)\n\nAnomaly shots, Ie scarred bitten ear in close up for a cat.. Polydactyl etc.. \n\nAlert status, your animal has been found and chip details scanned, heads up message..? (gone missing from backyard) \n\nRegular walk zone set parameters so that any distance trackers don't ping unless you over-ride it to missing status, simple slider setting like an avalanche transceiver is set to either transmit or search.. \n\n (some pets if familiar with a walk location who get loose may gravitate towards the walk zone which is why an override is necessary for minimising false flags when on a regular familiar zone for daily exercise. \n\nRoom for any salient detail.\nA \"trusted alternate persons\" slot for picking up a wandering pet  if original contact is unable to come out and collect (ie grandma /grandpa) that can only be released (seen along with a verification code) to ensure pet is handed over to authorised individuals (like a food delivery code)\n\nWould this be on a rolling subscription charge,  a buy in, and a fee for accessing details beyond a certain point, or something else?\n\nI could see it being useful to log adoption dogs from the outset, breeders (puppy shots would need to be updated) and useful to responsible breeders who may swoop in to take back a dog that has been dumped.. (so breeder details also give insight to a dog's dna / purebreed / mixed breed status which would help a shelter exponentially as to numerous factors,  breed rescue coordination etc (improving re-homing chances)\n\nInteresting in principle, how many similar products on the market and which country is this being developed for initially? \n\nCheers",
