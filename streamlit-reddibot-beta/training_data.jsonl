{"mkat23": {"timestamp": "08-02-2025 16:08:08", "input": "How does adding more steps and requiring others who most likely don\u2019t know what the product is or how to work it as well as requiring them to be in direct contact with an animal they don\u2019t know supposed to prioritize simplicity? I\u2019m genuinely curious, cause that doesn\u2019t make any sense. Also AirTags last for a long while and don\u2019t require charging either, so they remove the need for someone to scan your pet\u2019s collar or even interact with a pet at all, not every cat or dog is gonna be cool with strangers. That\u2019s far from what I would consider simplicity. You could literally just make a collar that has a pouch for air tags and whatever the android equivalent are or one that doesn\u2019t require being scanned. If someone\u2019s cat gets outside and gets hurt or stuck somewhere, how is their owner supposed to know where to go look for them unless some random person walks past and notices the cat, especially if the cat isn\u2019t easily visible from wherever someone may HOPEFULLY walk past? Then how would that random person know what app to use and how? What if they don\u2019t have strong service or don\u2019t have data or enough battery to download an app that they will probably never use again?\n\nI know I\u2019m most likely being rude, but come on\u2026 whose idea was it to take something that already exists and make it more complicated? Just sell little pouches to attach to a collar that can hold a gps tracker like air tags. There\u2019s also plenty of similar products that are easier to use and track. I think there is a lot to improve on before this is a product worth using and even more to make it worth spending money on it.\n\nJust consider making changes, cause otherwise it\u2019s basically just a scam to make money while not offering anything that\u2019s actually helpful or simple to use. How are random people supposed to know they need to scan it? Are there going to be instructions in some waterproof pouch connected to the collar? What if an animal is skittish or aggressive towards strangers? It makes no sense. It seems like a waste of money.\n\nIf changes end up being made so the product is worth while and actually prioritizes simplicity then I would love to be updated to reconsider looking into using your product for my pets, especially my cat who goes pretty far sometimes when she goes outside.", "output": "Thanks for the thorough and honest feedback! We appreciate you taking the time to share your perspective on how we can improve.\n\nWhile our NFC Pet Tag isn't a real-time GPS tracker like an AirTag, it focuses on simplicity and accessibility, offering battery-free operation and instant access to vital pet information via any smartphone.
